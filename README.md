Some of the topics are also accompanied with posts on my blog [igorski.co](https://igorski.co/) .

* Creating a basic RESTful API
* [Using Thymeleaf templates](https://igorski.co/java/spring-boot/layout-dialect-spring-boot-2/)
* [Testing using MockMvc](https://igorski.co/java/spring-boot/mockmvc-test-spring-boot/)
* [Document the API with Spring REST Docs] (https://igorski.co/java/spring-boot/document-api-spring-rest-docs/)

You can use both Gradle and Maven to build the project.
